2. Implement penalty/barrier function code (outer loop).
    --> do task 2 and 3.

4. Maybe:     write some code to always check that D is P.D.
              ...and a function that does D=D+epsilon*I for a series of
              incrementing epsilons until (and a bit more) D is P.D.
              ...but should we check that ALL D_j are P.D., really? [p. 82-->]
