1. Test line search with f(x) = (1 - 10^a*x)^2

2. Test line search with test_func.m

3. Minimize rosenbrock.m
    Try many different starting points.

4. Do task 2 (main2.m) -- penalty.

5. Do task 3 -- penalty.


10. Maybe (J): (1) history
              (2) write some code to always check that D is P.D.
              ...and a function that does D=D+epsilon*I for a series of
              incrementing epsilons until (and a bit more) D is P.D.
              ...but should we check that ALL D_j are P.D., really? [p. 82-->]
