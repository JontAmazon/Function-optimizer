4. Probably:  write some code to always check that D is P.D.
              ...and a function that does D=D+epsilon*I for a series of
              incrementing epsilons until (and a bit more) D is P.D.
              ...but should we check that ALL D_j are P.D., really? [p. 82-->]

5. Do nice prints.
